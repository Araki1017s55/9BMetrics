Hi, all.
I've learned Inmotion protocol more detailed,
temperature can be found in 32, and 34 byte of ex_data,
 and in 33 byte is always similar to 32 byte, 
 so we can see to different temperature in inmotion V8, 
 and maybe 3 different in others.
Also, I found this:

case DontKnow = 0x0F780101
It is diffrent Alerts, I was able to figure out the meaning of some of them.
For example:
0101780F20021601341A0000080201 this is Low Battery Alert (when the wheel lifts the pedals)

after IDValue goes Alert ID, so 0x20 is Battery low, after it always goes 0x02, then goes two 16-bit additional digit, in case "low battery" I don't know what in first, but second is voltage, for example there 6708 -> 67.08 volt
Also i know alert ids:
21 - speed cut-off (at 38-43 km/h), first digit -don't know, second - current speed calculated as usual
06 - speed limit (usual 30, but when battery below 40% - it is falls), first - speed limit (int/1000) , second - current speed (usual speed calculating)
19 - fall down (Be careful alert), first -don't know, second - don't know
05 - something like "starting after idle", when you release carry button, first - starting angle, second - current speed (usual)
26 - something like "overcurrent", usual happens when you trying speed up too fast (at speed over 20), first - maybe current (int/1000), usual in range 24-26 (Amps), but I don't realy know, second - current speed (usual).

Also, I find time and date in 53-59 bytes, date is corrent but time isn't. There are RTC with battery in wheel controller, so, maybe App should correct it, but I don't know how.

@ILYA2606 , @fgorina I think will be great to log this in yours Apps, it may help, to understood what happened. And I trying to find JumpMaster and Cedric Hauber, to add it in android WheelLog (this topic ), but looks like they disappeared from April and February.
