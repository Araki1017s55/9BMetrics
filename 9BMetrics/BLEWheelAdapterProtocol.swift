/// BLEWheelAdapterProtocol must be used to build adapters for different wheels
/// Esentially receives start/stop Recording calls for initializing and closing data
/// Connected/Disconnected calls when device connects or disonnects at the BLE level
/// charUpdated when data is received.
///
/// If the protocol has state it must be maintained in the adapter. The adapter is created
/// when the connection is done and is eliminated when the connection is closed
/// The adapter must generate a kHeaderDataReadyNotification when all header data
/// (name, Serial number, Version) is received or immediately if there is not this data (generate stubs)
///
/// Information received and analyzed must be given back from charUpdated in an array of ntuples
///
/// (WheelValue, Date, Value(Double) in SI Units (m, m/s, A, V, s, J, w)
/// Look at WheelTrack for definitions of WheelValues
///
/// All scaling, etc must be done from the adapter so all wheels seem similar
///
/// get functions give access to the name, version and serialNumber in string form
/// if the wheel gives them in another format (ex. as integers, etc.) transform them to
/// readable String form.
///
/// Date may be generated by the wheel tagging the values. If not use a NSDate() to generate it
///
/// Generate only wheel values, GPS, Altimeter and other posible values from the iPhone
/// are generated and mixed from the SimulatedClient
///
/// Also realise that the adapter ONLY contacts to the SimulatedClient and NO to the WheelTrack to factorize
/// better things and made everyting simpler.
